# Database Project

In this team project (3 members) we were assigned to create a relational database engine, parser, and application from scratch using a SQL like language to interact with the engine. This was to simplify the tasks needed to be able to complete the desired specs in a timely manner within the class. This was a 4 week project where we had 4 deliverables each week. In this project we as a team learned how important it is to communicate with your team members, complete tasks by the deadlines you create for yourself, and learn how to change ideas in your design on the fly.

This project was broken up into 4 deliverables:

1. Design Spec and Documents
2. Database Engine
3. Parser
4. Application

NOTE: We used Texas A&M University servers to compile and run our program.
