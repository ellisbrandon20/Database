# Database Project

In this team project (3 members) we were assigned to create a database engine, parser, and application from scratch using a SQL like language to interact with the engine. This was to simplify the tasks needed to be able to complete the desired specs in a timely manner within the class. This was a 4 week project where we had 4 deliverables each week. 

This project was broken up into 4 deliverables:

1. Design Spec and Documents
2. Database Engine
3. Parser
4. Application

If you wish to download this code and run our application please refer to the WIKI page. 
NOTE: We used Texas A&M University servers to compile and run our program.
